## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Verify everything is ready
bash bin/check.sh

# 2. Launch (starts both API + UI)
./start.sh

# 3. Open in browser
#    Local:  http://localhost:8501
#    Phone:  http://<your-lan-ip>:8501  (shown in terminal)
```

To stop everything: `./start.sh stop`

## Architecture Overview

AI RemixMate is split into three layers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Streamlit UI  (port 8501) PRIMARY   │   ← Supported user interface
│  Static HTML   (port 8000 at /)      │   ← Internal/experimental only
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FastAPI Backend (port 8000)         │   ← REST API, job queue, async tasks
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Core Engine (30+ modules)           │   ← Audio processing, ML, GPU ops
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Frontend model:** The Streamlit UI (`scripts/ui/app.py`, port 8501) is the **primary supported interface**. The static HTML UI served by FastAPI at `http://localhost:8000/` is an internal/experimental frontend — it may lag behind the Streamlit feature set and is not the documented run path.

The API runs long tasks (stem splitting, remixes, downloads) as background jobs. You can poll job status from the UI or via `GET /jobs/{job_id}`. Up to 4 concurrent jobs run at once.

### Runtime directories

All runtime paths follow `scripts/core/paths.py`:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `library/` | Downloaded songs (one subdirectory per song) |
| `outputs/` | Rendered mixes (one subdirectory per session ID) |
| `data/` | SQLite DB, embeddings, audit log (`data/audit.jsonl`) |
| `models/` | ML model weights |

Docker volumes and the Dockerfile use these same canonical paths.

## UI Pages

### 🏠 Home
Dashboard with quick-action cards. Jump straight into any workflow — download, remix, analyze. Shows library stats (total songs, songs with stems, disk usage) and API health status.

### 📚 Library
Browse all downloaded songs. Each song card shows name, file size, available stems, and license type. Paginated (25/50/100 per page) with search. Click any song to see details, play audio, or trigger stem separation.

### ⬇️ Download
Download tracks from YouTube Music. Paste a URL or type a search query.

- **Single track**: Search by name or paste a YouTube/YouTube Music URL. Optionally auto-split stems after download.
- **Playlist**: Paste a playlist URL to download all tracks (limit up to 200). Each track shows individual progress.

Downloaded songs land in `library/<Artist - Title>/` with `full.wav`, `meta.json`, and `license.json`.

### 🔗 Compatibility
Check if two songs mix well together *before* downloading. Enter artist + title for both songs and get an instant compatibility score based on:

- **BPM match** — How close their tempos are (±6% is ideal)
- **Key compatibility** — Camelot wheel harmony (same key, adjacent keys, relative major/minor)
- **Energy match** — Vibe alignment

No downloads needed — uses metadata APIs (GetSongBPM, Last.fm, MusicBrainz) with local librosa fallback.

### 🎛️ DJ Remix
Create a DJ-style transition between two songs from your library.

**Parameters you control:**
- **Transition length**: 8, 16, 32, or 64 bars
- **Genre preset**: techno, house, hip-hop, trap, dnb, ambient, or auto-detect
- **Bridge beat**: none, auto-synthesized, or upload your own WAV
- **Transition effect**: auto, echo, filter, reverb, or none

The engine handles phrase detection, beat alignment, EQ crossfading, and harmonic matching automatically. Output renders as a WAV file you can download or play in-browser.

### 🎚️ DJ Chain
Build a continuous multi-song DJ mix (2–8 songs). Same controls as DJ Remix, but chained — the engine plans transitions between each consecutive pair, locking phrases and managing energy flow across the full set.

### 🧪 Instrument Lab
The wildest feature. Pick 2+ songs that have stems and generate hybrid combinations — vocals from Song A over drums from Song B with bass from Song C. The engine:

- Time-stretches all stems to a common BPM
- Normalizes gain across stems
- Generates either "targeted" (single-stem swaps) or "all" (full permutation) combinations
- Renders each combination as a playable WAV

### 🔍 Analyze
Deep-dive into any library song's musical DNA:

- **Genre detection** — rule-based classifier across 10 genres (techno, house, hip-hop, trap, dnb, ambient, pop, rock, jazz, classical)
- **Structure analysis** — section breakdown (intro, verse, chorus, drop, break, outro) with timestamps
- **Musical features** — BPM, key, Camelot code, energy curve, danceability, vocal density, spectral characteristics

### 🔮 Smart Search
Find songs in your library using the 35-dimensional RAG vector index. Search by similarity to a reference song — the index weights BPM (40%), key/mode (35%), energy (10%), rhythm complexity (8%), and vocal/timbre character (7%).

### 🗜️ Compress Library
Convert all WAV stems to lossless FLAC (~50% space savings, identical quality). Runs as a batch background job. Can optionally delete the original WAVs after compression.

### 🚀 Initialize Library
One-shot pipeline for setting up or refreshing the entire library:
1. Stem-split all songs that don't have stems yet (Demucs)
2. Compress WAV stems to FLAC
3. Rebuild the RAG vector index

### 🎨 Visualizer
Audio visualization and waveform inspection for library tracks.

### 🎵 My Mixes
Browse previously rendered remixes and DJ chains, organized by session. Play, download, or delete old mixes.

## GPU Acceleration

The engine auto-detects your GPU on startup:

| Hardware | Backend | What gets accelerated |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) | MPS (Metal) | STFT, cosine similarity, time stretching, resampling, Demucs inference |
| NVIDIA GPU | CUDA | Same as above |
| No GPU | CPU | Everything still works, just slower for Demucs (~2x) |

Override with: `REMIXMATE_DEVICE=cpu ./start.sh`

---

## Security

- **Path traversal protection** — All library paths sanitized with `Path.resolve()` + containment check
- **CORS locked** — API only accepts requests from `localhost:8501` origins
- **XSRF protection** — Enabled in Streamlit config
- **No shell injection** — All subprocess calls use list args (no `shell=True`)
- **File upload validation** — 100MB limit + audio format whitelist
- **Audit logging** — Immutable JSONL log of all operations

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `REMIXMATE_DEVICE` | auto | Force GPU backend: `mps`, `cuda`, or `cpu` |
| `REMIXMATE_HTTPS` | (unset) | Set to `1` or `true` to force HTTPS mode |
| `REMIXMATE_LIBRARY_CAP_GB` | 50 | Max library size in GB |
| `JAMENDO_CLIENT_ID` | (unset) | Jamendo API key for Creative Commons tracks |

### start.sh Options

```bash
./start.sh              # Start API + UI (HTTP)
./start.sh --https      # Start with HTTPS (auto-generates certs)
./start.sh api          # API only
./start.sh ui           # UI only
./start.sh stop         # Kill all processes
./start.sh --no-https   # Force HTTP even if certs exist
```

## Typical Workflows

### Building a DJ Set
1. **Download** → Download 5–10 tracks from YouTube Music
2. **Analyze** → Check compatibility between pairs
3. **Stem Split** → Run Demucs on all tracks (batch)
4. **Compress** → Convert stems to FLAC to save space
5. **DJ Chain** → Build a continuous mix with automatic transitions
6. **Download mix** → Export the rendered WAV

### Creative Stem Mashups
1. **Download** two songs you want to mashup
2. **Stem Split** both tracks
3. **Instrument Lab** → Generate combinations (vocals from A + drums from B, etc.)
4. **Listen** → Browse and play all generated combinations
5. **Export** the ones you like

### Quick Compatibility Check
1. Go to **Compatibility** page
2. Enter artist + title for two songs (no download needed)
3. Get instant BPM, key, and energy compatibility scores
4. If compatible → download both → remix

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot reach API at localhost:8000"**
→ The API server isn't running. Run `./start.sh` (starts both API and UI together).

**Stems showing as empty / not found**
→ Run stem separation first: go to the song in Library → click "Split Stems". Or use the batch endpoint.

**Demucs is slow**
→ Expected: 2–5 minutes per song on CPU, ~1 minute on GPU. Make sure GPU is detected (`bash bin/check.sh` shows GPU status).

**Port already in use**
→ Run `./start.sh stop` first, then `./start.sh` again.

**Browser shows HTTPS warning**
→ Self-signed cert issue. Use HTTP mode instead: `./start.sh --no-https`
