"""
scripts/core/audio_source.py — Source-audio resolution for the render path.

A song's playable source may be stored in any of several forms depending on
where it sits in the download → enhance → stem-separate → prune lifecycle:

    full.wav            original downloaded mix (often pruned away to save space)
    full_enhanced.wav   mastered/enhanced mix kept after pruning
    <stem>.flac / .wav  Demucs stems (vocals/drums/bass/other)

With ``prune_on_download`` enabled, most songs lose ``full.wav`` and keep only
``full_enhanced.wav`` + stems.  The DJ render path historically opened
``full.wav`` directly, so it failed on the bulk of a pruned library.  This
module resolves a song name to usable audio, trying each form in priority
order, so the engine works on the whole library — not just the few songs that
still have ``full.wav``.
